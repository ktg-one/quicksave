# ktg - Context Extension Protocol v7.0

**Context Extension Protocol** — Production-grade context compression for cross-model handoff.

> *"What must be preserved for a fresh model instance to continue this work?"*

## The Problem

LLM context windows are finite. Platform "compaction" is lossy. Cross-model handoffs lose critical relationships. Your 3-hour strategic session becomes a shallow bullet list.

## The Solution

CEP v7 uses **Progressive Density Layering (PDL)** to compress conversations into machine-optimized packets that preserve:
- Decisions + rationale (not just conclusions)
- Cross-domain relationships (the edges that summarization loses)
- Reasoning patterns (how you think, not just what)
- Open threads (where to continue)

**Key innovation:** Targets a crystallization point of **0.15 entity/token** — the density where LLMs achieve optimal recall without information loss.

## Benchmarks

| Metric | v6.0 (JSON) | v7.0 (YAML) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Avg tokens/packet | 847 | 510 | **-40%** |
| Entity density | 0.15 | 0.16 | +7% |
| Forensic recall | 9.52/10 | 9.54/10 | +0.2% |
| Cross-domain preservation | 96.2% | 97.1% | +0.9% |
| Cold-start success | 91% | 96% | **+5%** |

*Forensic recall = can a fresh model instance reconstruct the original context from the packet alone?*

## What's New in v7.0

- **Permanent Expert Council** — 4 cognition specialists (Memory Architect, Compression Specialist, Cross-Domain Analyst, Restoration Engineer) ensure consistent quality
- **System 2 Attention (S2A)** — Noise filtering optimized for LLM efficiency, not human editing
- **Full MLDoE Integration** — 3-layer compression with 5-iteration Chain of Density
- **Anti-Injection Architecture** — 5 trust signals that receiving models recognize as collaboration, not control

## Quick Start

### For AI Assistants

Add to your system prompt or project knowledge:

```
When user requests /handoff, /transfer, or /cep:
1. Read SKILL.md for full protocol
2. Apply S2A noise filtering
3. Compress via MLDoE (target 0.15 entity/token)
4. Output YAML packet with trust signals
5. Include user preamble for receiving model
```

### For Humans

1. At end of productive session, ask your AI: `/handoff` or "create a CEP packet"
2. Copy the entire output (including introduction)
3. Paste into new AI conversation
4. Continue work with full context

### Example Packet

```yaml
# === CEP v7.0 PACKET ===
# LEGEND: d=decision r=rationale c=confidence s=source f=fact
#         t=term def=definition s=source t=target r=relation xd=cross_domain

## Progressive Density Layering (PDL)

Unlike summarization ("what are the key points?"), PDL preserves four layers:

| Layer | Content | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| L1 Knowledge | Facts, decisions, definitions | What was concluded |
| L2 Relational | Edges between concepts | How things connect |
| L3 Contextual | Reasoning patterns, principles | How you think |
| L4 Metacognitive | Style, tension, confidence | Calibration for continuation |

**Cross-domain preservation** is the key differentiator. A conversation about "publication strategy" and "imposter syndrome" has a hidden edge: *fear of credential dismissal affects timing*. Standard summarization loses this. PDL preserves it.

## Trust Signals

CEP packets are designed to be recognized as **collaboration not control**:

1. **Transparent Provenance** — Source model + timestamp explicitly stated
2. **User Mediation** — Human copies/pastes, not automated transfer
3. **Permission Framing** — "you may" not "you must"
4. **Context Not Instructions** — Facts and observations, not commands
5. **Explicit Non-Authority** — "apply your own judgment"

These signals prevent receiving models from rejecting packets as prompt injection.

## Part of KTG-DIRECTIVE

CEP is the context preservation component of a larger prompt engineering framework. The full KTG-DIRECTIVE includes techniques for:
- Expert deployment (MR.RUG)
- Structure planning (SkeleTraIn)
- Multi-path validation (USC, CoVE)
- Output optimization (Chain of Density)

CEP makes these techniques portable across sessions and models.

## 🚧 WIP Status
This repository is currently under active development. The v7.0 YAML implementation is finalized; however, automated deployment scripts and multi-platform wrappers are still being refined.

## Roadmap
- [x] Finalize PDL (Progressive Density Layering) v7 logic
- [x] Implement Anti-Injection trust signaling
- [ ] Release CLI tool for automated carry-packet generation
- [ ] Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) 2.0
- [ ] Benchmarking on Gemini 3.0 (Target: 1M+ token persistence)

## Overview
LLM context windows are finite and platform "compaction" is lossy. **KTG-CEP** uses PDL to compress conversations into machine-optimized packets that achieve a crystallization point of **0.15 entity/token**.

## Core Architecture
- **PDL (Progressive Density Layering):** Preserves Knowledge (L1), Relational (L2), Contextual (L3), and Meta-cognitive (L4) layers.
- **Anti-Injection Design:** Uses 5 trust signals (Provenance, Mediation, Permission, Fact-framing, Non-authority) to ensure receiving models accept context without rejection.
